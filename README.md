# Mechanic Miner 2023

Mechanic Miner 2023 (MM23) is a co-creative game design tool that suggests game design ideas by exploring the source code of the game itself instead of relying on pre-defined domain knowledge. Exploration is driven by a genetic algorithm which generates, evaluates and evolves simple two-state game mechanics that use code reflection to manipulate a property of the game's source code during gameplay. Evaluation is performed by an automated game-playing agent driven by Go-Explore, a state-of-the-art algorithm for automated game-playing.

This repository contains the MM23 system as part of a Unity project for a simple 2D platformer. It demonstrates how MM23 can generate a diverse set of often novel solutions for this game within a timeframe that suits iterative creative work.
